<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His provided tremendous contributions to quantum theory. He founded quantum field theory (with Dirac equation), which predicted the existence of antimatter &amp; matter-antimatter annihilation. Dirac was also the first to formulate quantum electrodynamics.</p>

<p>In a massive understatement one former player said &ldquo;he&rsquo;s hard to please&rdquo;, after his team had once won a title deciding match 5-0 he forbade the celebrating players to drink champagne for almost letting in a goal at the end.</p>

nieszche-pregnant-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,Default Category/Philosophy",base,Nietzsche Pregnant,"<p>Nietzsche<br /> The famnous/infamous words of Friedrich Nietzsche, 'God is Dead' have always meant so much more to me than their original religious context. Essentially, he was saying that we have created God, but there is no such being, so we are free to do as we will. He even said that we are the ultimate murderers, and asked what we can do to attone for this most awful crime. The answer is obvious: it is up to us to look after each other, to be the Gods we hope for. <br /> The designs take that idea and apply it to all man-made heroes, guardians and icons of protection. For me superheroes are very powerful, instantly recognisable images, and to kill them (as much as I love them) in a way, is to say that we must be our own superheroes, which I think is ultimately a very positive message.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,nietzsche-pregnant-t-shirt,Nietzsche Pregnant,Nietzsche Pregnant,"<p>A t shirt admiring Nietzsche, the famous philosopher and all-round genius.
