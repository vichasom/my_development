gremlins-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Film,base,Gremlins,"<p>This t-shirt design admires the 1984 horror comedy 'Gremlins'. Originally released as a PG rated film, it was quickly changed to PG13+ over concerns of some of the violence in the film. To me though, the dark &amp; scary aspects to this film contrasted against the cuteness of Gizmo is what made it so great - the original Gremlins was much darker than the sequel, and as a kid, it scared the hell out of me! Like most 80's films, Gremlins now seems cheesy and the special effects which seemed ""so real"" when it came out are laughable now. Still, Gremlins is a film that all 1980's kids will remember and is a classic to me!</p>",,,0,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,gremlins-t-shirt,Gremlins,Gremlins,<p>Gremlins T shirt. violent muppets.
