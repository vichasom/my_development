<p>It is a fine ancient Greek sculpture but it also has an interesting story attached to its re-discovery.</p>
<p>You can read the full story <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_de_Milo"" target=""_blank"">here</a> , but basically it was found by a peasant farmer in 1820, on the island of Milo. It was then sold to a visiting French naval officer, who's captain wasn't happy about transporting it home. The officer appealed to the French Ambassador for help. The ambassador took too long to respond so the peasant decided to sell it to someone else. Then, just as the new buyer was loading it onto a ship bound for Constantinople, a representative of the French ambassador finally turned up and seized the Venus de Milo and had the second sale&nbsp;annulled by the island chiefs (who were later whipped and fined for this).</p>
<p>Eventually the Venus de Milo made it to the Louvre in Paris, where it remains to this day.</p>
