spirit-of-ecstasy-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,Spirit of Ecstasy,"<p>This design admires the world famous 'Spirit of Ecstacy' ornament that adornes Rolls-Royce automobiles.</p>
<p>In the early 1900's Rolls-Royce was quickly becoming known as a must have for the wealthy.</p>
<p>At the time Rolls-Royce radiators were topped by a radiator cap (as would be expected) but a new fashion was sweeping the industry with 'hood ornaments' becoming popular, especially on the more expensive cars.<br />Rolls-Royce was prompted to design their own ornament and commisioned Charles Sykes to create one.<br />A few years earlier, Sykes had been asked to make a hood ornament for Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, who was a well connected MP and editor of 'The Car' magazine.<br />Montagu was having a secretive, passionate relationship at the time with his secretary Elanor Velasco Thornton, and he asked Sykes to use Elanor as a model for the ornament.<br />When asked by Rolls-Royce to design the ornament, Sykes was given a brief that seemed to fit very closely to the ornament made for Mantagu, so he used a slightly modified version of it.<br />Sykes himself referred to the Spirit as ""A graceful little goddess, the Spirit of Ecstasy, who has selected road travel as her supreme delight and alighted on the prow of a Rolls-Royce motor car to revel in the freshness of the air and the musical sound of her fluttering draperies"" ...that may be a little over the top, but it <em>is</em> a beautiful design that fits perfectly to the Rolls-Royce image and has become an icon over the years.<br /><a title=""Eleanor Thornton"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Thornton""></a></p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,spirit-of-ecstasy-t-shirt,Spirit of Ecstasy,Spirit of Ecstasy,"<p>The hood ornament of the Rolls-Royce company is celebrated here in this t-shirt from We Admire.net. 'The Spirit of Ecstasy' soars over our roads still today, as a symbol of prestige and freedom.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
