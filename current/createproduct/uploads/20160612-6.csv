<p>Since 1851, the America's Cup has attracted top sailors and yacht designers from all over the globe.</p>
<p>It is not only a test of sailing skill, boat and sail design, but also of fund-raising and management skills. From the first defense in 1870 the matches were between very large (65&nbsp;ft (20&nbsp;m) or greater on the waterline) racing yachts owned by wealthy sportsmen. This culminated in races between magnificent J-class yachts in 1930, 1934 and 1937.</p>
<p>After World War II almost twenty years went by without a challenge, so the New York Yacht Club made changes to the Deed to allow the smaller and less expensive 12 metre class yachts to compete, and this class was used until 1987 when it was replaced by the International America's Cup Class.<br /> <br /> My design has a list of all the winners of the America's cup from 1851 to 1995</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,america-s-cup-t-shirt,America's Cup,America's Cup,<p>J Class Americas Cup t shirt.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
