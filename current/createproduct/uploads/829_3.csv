custom-v-twin-motorcycle-yukio-miyamoto-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,V-Twin (Yukio Miyamoto),"<p>In this series of T-shirts, using the work of Yukio Miyamoto, we admire exquisite work with Adobe Illustrator as well as the objects themselves. These illustrations are produced using Adobe Illustrator and can be reproduced in any size without loss of detail or resolution. The detail is astonishing in all these illustrations and probably at it most astonishing in care of the simulation of reflections in polished surfaces.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">This is an image of a Zero Engineering Samurai Chopper with a goosenecked custom frame and Zero Engineering's Springer fork. Zero Engineering were founded in Japan by Shinya Kimura in the early 90's. </span> <span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">The engine is almost certainly a 93 cubic inch aluminium Shovelhead engine by S&amp;S modelled on the Harley V twin that was in production from about 1966 &ndash; 1984. The transmission is a Baker 6 speed with a kick start. The words Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead refer to the the engineering or appearance of the heads/rocker covers of Harley V twin engines. To some extent it is a shorthand means of defining the vintage of a given engine. Knuckle, Pan and Shovel particularly refer to the shape and style of the rocker covers. The carb on the bike illustrated here by Yukio is an SU, a very rare sight on a motorbike. SU's were notably fitted to Jaguar cars, three each in the case of E Types. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">This is a bike built to go slowly through crowded spaces. It looks gorgeous and I expect it sounds better. These bikes are almost one offs. The devil and the expense are in the details, components like hand grips, switches, foot controls and pegs and lights will often be CNC machined from solid billets. The saddle will typically be a hand stitched labour of love perhaps made from the hide of some rare species or other.</span></p>
