People who think they know best but whom the evidence shows know nothing. The Stasi and their ilk were among the few who could afford a reel to reel tape recorder that cost the same as a small car of its day: a Mini, less purchase tax and vat, was probably less than &pound;575 in 1970. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">The tape on the reel to reel was just 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an inch, 3.8mm deep. The motor was quartz regulated such that Newton's laws of angular momentum were controlled. Wow and flutter were all but eliminated regardless of how the oft concealed machine moved with the person or thing carrying it.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">With the intricate circuitry and batteries there was no room for a motor to rewind the tape. This was accomplished through a small and exquisite hand crank driving through a gearbox. The audio quality was such that the taped sound could be applied directly to film. When they were not in the hands of the noire side of life they could be found on movie locations in the pockets of actors and sound men and no doubt women too. </span></p>
