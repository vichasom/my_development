He was famous for his love of fishing and gave many quotes relating to this.<br /> Some of these include:</p>
<p>- ""There are only two occasions when Americans respect privacy, especially in Presidents. Those are prayer and fishing""</p>
<p>- ""All men are equal, before Fish""</p>
<p>- ""Fishing is much more than fish. It is the great occasion when we may return to the fine simplicity of our forefathers""</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>- ""Be patient and calm - for no one can catch fish in anger"" - This is my favourite quote and the one I have used in my design.</p>
