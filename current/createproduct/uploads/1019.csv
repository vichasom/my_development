<p><em>Bullitt</em> is probably best-remembered for its car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco featuring a 1968 <a href=""http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_2159-Ford-Mustang-1968.html"" target=""_blank"">Ford Mustang 390</a> and a 1968 <a href=""http://www.allpar.com/model/charger.html"" target=""_blank"">Dodge Charger R/T 440 Magnum</a> .</p>
<p>The decision to rely on the sound of engines and tyre squeals, not music, makes it all the more adrenaline pumping. Although legend has it that dissatisfied with the original sound from the location, <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/steve-mcqueen-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">McQueen</a> subsequently took to a race track with a sound recordist and a determination to provide some gear and engine noise with real grunt. What is well know to movie geeks, and noticeable to anyone who has seen the movie on more than one occasion, is the recurrent appearance of a particular green <a href=""http://weadmire.net/search/?keywords=VW+Beetle&amp;search_button=Search"" target=""_blank"">VW Beetle</a> on the streets of San Francisco. With limited time to shoot the sequence, and the city authorities only allowing a certain amount of the city to be closed off, the film makers were further limited to the number of prop vehicles available, and perhaps were less concerned at continuity in a non video &lsquo;playback and study&rsquo; era. Hence the appearance and re-appearance of the Beetle.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,bullitt-1968-t-shirt,Bullitt (1968),Bullitt (1968),<p>Bullitt t shirt.
