peter-sellers-t-shirt-1,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Film,Default Category/Popular Culture",base,Peter Sellers,"<p>Richard Henry Sellers, CBE, commonly known as Peter Sellers (8 September 1925 &ndash; 24 July 1980) was a British comedian and actor best known for his roles in Dr. Strangelove, as Chief Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther film series, as Clare Quilty in the original 1962 screen version of Lolita, in comedy films such as The Millionairess and The Party, and as the guileless man-child Chance in his penultimate film, Being There.<br /> Sellers rose to fame on the BBC Home Service radio series The Goon Show. His ability to speak in different accents (e.g., French, Indian, American, British, German), along with his talent to portray a range of characters to comedic effect, contributed to his success as a radio personality and screen actor and earned him national and international nominations and awards. Many of his characters became ingrained in public perception of his work. Sellers's private life was characterized by turmoil and crises, and included emotional problems and substance abuse. Sellers was married four times&mdash;his second wife was the Swedish actress Britt Ekland&mdash;with three children from two of his marriages.<br /> Sellers had a difficult personal life. He often clashed with actors and directors, including a strained relationship with friend and director Blake Edwards, with whom he worked on the Pink Panther series and The Party. The two sometimes stopped speaking to each other during filming. <br /> Sellers's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding. His behaviour caused physical and emotional hurt to others, notably his first three wives. As portrayed in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, he told his eight-year-old son that the boy's mother (Sellers's wife at the time) was having an affair. Sellers is known to have assaulted Britt Ekland, prompted by unsubstantiated jealousy. On occasion however, Sellers blamed himself for his failed marriages. In the famous 1974 Parkinson interview, he admitted that ""I'm not easy to live with"". He explained that the divorce from his first wife Anne Howe had been due to a romance with ""someone I worked with"", suggesting that it had been Sophia Loren, as indicated by Sellers playfully humming their mutual single hit Goodness Gracious Me, when asked by Parkinson about the purported affair. <br /> His work with Orson Welles on Casino Royale deteriorated as Sellers became jealous of Welles's casual relationship with Princess Margaret. The relationship between the two actors created problems during filming, as Sellers refused to share the set with Welles, who himself was no stranger to strident behaviour. Sellers could be cruel and disrespectful, as demonstrated by his treatment of actress Jo Van Fleet on the set of I Love You, Alice B. Toklas. On one occasion, Van Fleet had declined an invitation to his house, soon followed by a misunderstanding between the two actors during filming. This prompted Sellers to a tirade against Van Fleet in front of actors and crew. <br /> Sellers was reticent about discussing his private life. On The Muppet Show (season 2) in a ""backstage"" chat with Kermit the Frog, Sellers declined to step out of character, explaining comedically that he had ""no real me"" because he had had it ""surgically removed"". He was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, but agreed under the condition that he could appear in character. Sellers appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo, impersonating the Kenneth Mars character in The Producers. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down for what is considered one of Parkinson's most memorable interviews. <br /> It has been suggested that Sellers suffered depression spurred by deep-seated anxieties of artistic and personal failure. Some behaviour may have been exacerbated by substance abuse, for Sellers regularly smoked cannabis, drank large amounts of alcohol, and used other recreational drugs. It is believed that his drug use, especially amyl nitrites, contributed to heart attacks in 1964. Sellers became aware that his frail psyche affected his career and life, but rather than seek professional counselling he opted for periodic consultations with astrologer Maurice Woodruff, who seemed to have held considerable sway over his later career.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,peter-sellers-t-shirt-1,Peter Sellers,Peter Sellers,<p>Comedian and actor Peter Sellers is celebrated here on this t shirt from weadmire.net.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
