citroen-2cv-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,Citroen 2CV,"<p>The&nbsp; Citroen 2CV (French: deux chevaux, literally meaning &quot;two horses&quot;) was an economy car produced by the French automaker Citroen from 1949 to 1990. The 2CV belongs to a very short list of vehicles introduced right after World War II that remained relevant and competitive for many decades - in the case of the 2CV, 42 years. The 2CV was a great commercial success: within months of it going on sale, there was a three-year waiting list. The waiting list was soon increased to five years. At that time a second-hand 2CV was more expensive than a new one because the buyer did not have to wait. Production was increased from four units per day in 1949 to 400 units per day in 1950. The Citroen pictured on the t-shirt is the 2CV Spot (1976).&nbsp;</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,citroen-2cv-t-shirt,Citroen 2CV,Citroen 2CV,<p>The Citroen pictured on the t-shirt is the 2CV Spot (1976).

clockwork-orange-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Film,base,Clockwork Orange,"<p>This t-shirt design is in admiration of the controversial film by Stanley Kubrick.</p>
<p>The novel A Clockwork Orange by <a href=""http://www.anthonyburgess.org/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Burgess</a> was first published in 1962, selling fews copies until Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt it for the big screen, releasing it in 1971.&nbsp; Despite Kubrick declaring his celluloid offering 'his best made film' he withdrew it from UK distribution after he recieved death threats against his family. Kubrick enforced this ban throughout his life, suing London Scala cinema in the early 90s for screening the film.</p>
<p>The controversy and death threats arrose around the depiction within the film of gratuitously violent rape and robbery perpetrated by a gang of feral teenagers led by the psychotic Alex (played by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000532/"" target=""_blank"">Malcolm McDowell</a>), which was blamed for acting as a catalyst for two assaults and one gang rape shortly after it was shown in cinemas.</p>
<p>Burgess' novel paints a dark distopia which Kubrick deftly expressed through a visual style which still fascinates and disturbs.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a t-shirt design which captured a little of the psychotic nature of the main protagonist. I hope I have succeeded.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,clockwork-orange-t-shirt,Clockwork Orange,Clockwork Orange,<p>A clockwork orange t shirt. Malcolm McDowell.
