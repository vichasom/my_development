<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where to start?&nbsp; To a very real extent Merckx's five Tour victories, extraordinary in their number, margin and variety as they are, are the least of it.&nbsp; I think a case could be made that Eddy Merckx was the greatest endurance athlete of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sprinter, time trialist, climber, well'ard, he had it all.&nbsp; His first tour victory came in 1969.&nbsp; Just 24 yrs old he won all the available jerseys, GC, Sprint, KoM, and that awarded to the most combative rider.&nbsp; Had it been available he would also have won the White Jersey traditionally awarded to the highest placed rider younger than 25yrs.&nbsp; This is the only time one rider has won all the available jerseys in a Tour de France.&nbsp; He won the GC with a margin of 17mins 54 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quote all his wins is to overwhelm an audience but this man was a spontaneous competitor, fabulously brave and I think most unusually generous.&nbsp; Celebrate and admire a great athlete, wear our Eddy Merckx T shirt.</p>
