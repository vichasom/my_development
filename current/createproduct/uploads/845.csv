The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings called replicants.<br /> <br /> Roy Batty is the leader of the renegade Nexus-6 replicants. He is very intelligent, fast, and skilled at combat, and yet still learning how to deal with developing emotions. With an A Physical Level (Superhuman strength &amp; endurance) and an A Mental Level (Genius level intellect), he is probably the most dangerous of all the fugitive replicants. He is a combat model used off-world for military service and is said to have participated in every off-world battle and conflict from the fighting at the Tannhauser Gate to Massacre on the Venezeualan Moons. He leads a few fellow replicants in the hope of self-preservation. The ""prodigal son"" of Eldon Tyrell, Roy returns to his ""father."" First seeking a longer life, then asking forgiveness. With an extended life out of his grasp due to the errors of his own kind, and his ""questionable"" actions deemed ""extraordinary,"" Roy ultimately destroys his maker.<br /> <br /> There is no future for Roy, as his friends are killed, his hope for more life is quashed and finally his lover, Pris, is ""retired"" by the Blade Runner Rick Deckard.<br /> <br /> Deteriorating fast, he plays cat and mouse with Deckard, and chases him onto the roofs, where Deckard ends up hanging for dear life on a metal beam high above the ground. Roy saves Deckard's life, suggesting that perhaps he has gained the empathy that is the thin dividing line between the Humans and the Replicants. But because Roy becomes ""more human than human""&mdash;the motto line of the Tyrell Corporation&mdash;and illustrates more ""humanity"" than the men who seek to kill him, we are left wondering at what exactly makes us human. As he dies, Roy tells Deckard about the things he saw in his life and how all those memories would be gone forever. ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate. All those... moments will be lost in time... like... tears... in rain"". This leaves the question of what exactly he did see, or truly remembered.<br /> <br /> He eventually accepts his inevitable fate with a smile and the final line ""Time... to die."".<br /> <br /></p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,roy-batty-s-blade-runner-t-shirt,"Roy Batty's ""Blade Runner""","Roy Batty's ""Blade Runner""","<p>Roy Batty t shirt form Blade Runner, a film by Ridley Scott.
