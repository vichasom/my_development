<p>Born near Breslau, Germany (now Wroc??aw, Poland) Manfred was known to be a good athlete in his youth as well as a keen hunter.</p>
<p>Manfred began military training when he was only 11 years old, graduating in 1911, he joined the Uhlan Cavalry Unit, however barbed wire and machine guns were quickly making cavalry obsolete. Disapointed at his lack of combat opportunities, Manfred joined the Imperial German Air Service.</p>
<p>His life in the air began as a reconnaissance observer, but signs of his fighter ace spirit began to appear after he shot down an attacking French fighter with his observers gun.<br /> Deciding he liked flying, he began training for his own license and started as a pilot in the 'No. 2 bomber unit' - and once again, he downed another french aircraft.<br /> About this time, the Germans began to assemble a dedicated 'fighter squadron' led by fighter ace Oswald Boelcke, and Manfred was personally asked to join the new squadron with Boelcke.<br /> After his first confirmed victory, Richthofen ordered a silver cup engraved with the date and the type of enemy machine from a jeweller in Berlin. He continued this until he had 60 cups, by which time the supply of silver in blockaded Germany was restricted. His cups ended at 60 but his victories kept coming, in all, Richtofen down over 80 enemy aircraft becoming the most successful pilot of WW1.<br /> It didn't last though, and just after 11am on 21 April 1918, Richthofen was shot down by Australian soldiers on the ground as he flew low over their position. The soldiers saw Richthofen hastily land his plane and hurried to the site. They found him still alive, but died a short time later. His final words were: &quot;Kaputt&quot;.<br /> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Boelcke"" title=""Oswald Boelcke""></a></p>",,,0,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,red-baron-manfred-von-richthofen-t-shirt,Red Baron (Richthofen),Red Baron (Richthofen),"<p>This design honours the top flying ace of WW1, Manfred von Richthofen also known as The Red Baron.
