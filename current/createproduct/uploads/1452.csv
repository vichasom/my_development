<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaped like a ball of fluff, and with a tail that they can point straight up, the Wren is one of the UK's smallest birds (second only to the Goldcrest and Firecrest). This tiny bird is technically one of the most common of garden visitors, but due to their diminutive size, shy behaviour and drab plumage, spotting them is a challenge. They are like the Where's Wally of the bird world. Despite this however, they have a very loud and complicated song, and often pairs of Wrens will sing in duet. Almost like they want you to find them&hellip;.</p>
<p><br />They truly are one of my favourite creatures ever, and when I manage to spot one, I know its going to be a good day.</p>
