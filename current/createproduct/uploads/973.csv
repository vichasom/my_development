<p>It was founded in 1906 by&nbsp;the wealthy pioneer race driver and automobile enthusiast, Vincenzo Florio<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florio"" title=""Florio""></a> . Its length was originally 148&nbsp;km (92 miles) per lap, then was shortened twice to the 72&nbsp;km (45&nbsp;mi) lap that was used in the last decades, for usually 10 laps in the race.</p>
<p>It was an active event from 1906 until the late 1970's, it was stopped due to safety concerns... something which was unfortunate but understandable, with&nbsp;600hp+ cars racing through the small Italian villages with spectators standing next to or even on the roads!</p>
<p>Targa Florio tested the skills of greats such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Olivier Gendebien and Stirling Moss, who came to challenge Italian champions, Tazio Nuvolari, Alfieri Maserati, Achille Varzi and Nino Vaccarella.</p>
