Harry was a temporally employed electrical draughtsman who, on his own initiative, used his knowledge of circuit diagrams and applied it to the, then, current day underground design by FHS to produce the 1933 map.</p>
<p>The Underground management was a little unsure of how the public would take to such a revolutionary change in the design and a note on the front cover of a trial run of the map warned them of this.</p>
<p>In fact the map was accepted very well and was eventually to become held with great affection. The incorporation of the river was also to be greatly revered by tube travellers and has been to present day. This is the only surface feature shown on the map and although it too is a schematic representation, it provides a geographical datum which assists the interpretation and understanding of the map tremendously.</p>
<p>Harry Beck's format was an innovation that would become essential for the comprehensibility of complex networks of today's transport systems all over the world. The commercial value to London Transport and the rest of the world is immeasurable; for this he was paid 10 guineas, probably about two weeks wages in those days.</p>
