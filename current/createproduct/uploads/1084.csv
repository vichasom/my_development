He is globally recognised as the world's greatest ever theoretical physicist and one of the most influential people of all time.</p>
<p>He turned the physics world upside down &amp; inside out with his understanding and explainations of electrodynamics. Starting with his impressive paper in 1905 on mass-energy equivalence (Special Relativity), Einstein stated that the speed of light is fixed and that time is relative to each observer depending on their velocity.</p>
<p>He eliminated the need for luminiferous aether &ndash; one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time and deduced from his equations of special relativity that small amounts of mass can be converted into huge amounts of energy with what has been called the twentieth century&rsquo;s best-known equation: <em>E</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>mc</em> 2 and led to the development of nuclear power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used this equation in my design - mass (in kilograms) x celeritas (Latin for ""Swiftness"" representing the speed of light at 299,792,458 meters per second) <em>&nbsp;</em> 2 = Energy.<br /> The graphic is meant to represent both the splitting of an atom and the huge ""shock"" that Einstein delivered to the world of science.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,albert-einstein-energy-t-shirt,Albert Einstein (Energy),Albert Einstein (Energy),<p>What can be said about Albert Einstein that hasn't aready been said?
