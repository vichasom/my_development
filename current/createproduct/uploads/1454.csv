Step forward Bradley Wiggins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only people who have been to cycling club events &ndash; there is always a raffle and the prizes are generally rubbish &ndash; would understand Wiggin's speech from the TdF podium on the last day of the 2012 race &ldquo;Nah, I'm not doing it in French.&nbsp; I'm going to announce the winners of the raffle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's not to love about Bradley Wiggins? Not only has he become the first ever British winner of the Tour de France, he is witty and laid back in victory. No tears, no strutting, just good old fashioned cycle club humour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Bradley Wiggins t-shirt is one of a series we have created for <a href=""http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Cycling Weekly</a> in celebration of his greatness.</p>
