<p><br />This is the Lotus 49 owned by <a href=""http://www.classicteamlotus.co.uk/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Classic Team Lotus</a> and raced to a debut win by Jim Clark at Zandvoort in 1967. It was not the first racing car to have the engine as a stressed part of the chassis but it was certainly the most successful. In that regard it established this method of construction as the orthodox. The car was built round the <a href=""http://www.historicengines.com/dfv/specs.html"" target=""_blank"">Ford (Cosworth) DFV V8</a>. For many it is the epitome of how an F1 car should look, the epitome of what you see is what you get. The quality of the engineering is matched by the quality of Peter Hutton's illustration. Peter's illustrations fade to line at the extremities which makes them perfect for t shirts, the effect is to integrate them with the t-shirt in a way that is much more attractive than the result that comes from using more conventional images. &nbsp;In any case he is the best illustrator of a racing car that I have come across.</p>
<p>Buy this t-shirt and show you admire the Lotus 49, Jim Clark and Peter Hutton's exquisite artwork. <br /><br /></p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,peter-hutton-1967-lotus-49,Peter Hutton 1967 Lotus 49,Peter Hutton 1967 Lotus 49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
