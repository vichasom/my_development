freddie-mercury,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Music,base,Freddie Mercury,"<p>In 1982 I saw Queen at the Milton Keynes Bowl. I've seen a lot of concerts over the years and one might even say that musically they were better concerts. However, no one, in my experience since, has commanded the stage, has entertained or has been a more charismatic front man than Freddie Mercury. For those of you who did not see Queen in concert, you need only look at the Live Aid concert in 1985, when Freddie Mercury and Queen stole the show. There are a lot of performers I would like to have seen. Elvis, Frank Sinatra, Jimi Hendrix and a whole raft of others. But I can say that I saw Freddie Mercury and that 30 years on it remains one of my great and enduring memories.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,freddie-mercury,Freddie Mercury,Freddie Mercury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
