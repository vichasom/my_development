<p><br />Any colour as long as it is black, the Canon A1, introduced in 1978.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Arguably the camera that kicked off an era of intense competition and innovation in the development of super competent partially electronic SLRs between the Japanese manufacturers&nbsp; (Nikon, Pentax, <a href=""http://www.olympus.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Olympus</a>, Minolta, <a href=""http://www.yashica.com/"" target=""_blank"">Yashica</a>) that revolutionised and democratised photography&nbsp; through automating aperture, shutter speed, one or the other or both.&nbsp; In the process the once dominant West German camera industry was decimated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is said of sound amplification rubbish in rubbish out &ndash; amplifiers only make what you put into them louder, they do not enhance it.&nbsp; To a significant extent the same applies to artwork and its reproduction.&nbsp; Yukio Miyamoto's simulations and 3D models of cameras are beautifully realised, we reproduce them at 1440 dpi.&nbsp; The files when we send them to the printer are typically about a giga byte in size.&nbsp; The result is an extraordinary expression of enthusiasm and admiration.<br />&nbsp;</p>
