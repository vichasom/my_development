They are the enablers in the band. That they are not front men and their contribution is subtle and obscured is in the contract. Not so much the case with <a name=""Charlie Mingus"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus"">Charlie Mingus.</a> Mingus was a man in charge in just about every regard. His playing drove the bands he led but he was a master of of organisation and expression. This can seem obviously contradictory in that collective organisation is often seen to be the the antithesis of self expression. Not so with Mr Mingus who it was said was as concerned about the qualities of his band members personalities as he was about their technical ability. He wanted originality not contrivance.
