Lawrence Award (1962), the Nobel Prize in Physics (1965), the Oersted Medal (1972) and the National Medal of Science (1979).</p>
<p>Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but will also be remembered for his outgoing personality and ability to explain difficult scientific theories to the layman. Other interesting things about Feynman are that he studied Mayan Heiroglyphics, played the bongos and loved drawing.<br /> Feynman also worked on the Manhattan Project and served on the investigative board for the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was talented at many different things so I have used this variety of subjects in my design.<br /> It is based on a piece of interesting Mayan artwork, and within it I have hidden many things related to Feynman.<br /> These include, the Feynman Diagram, the Feynman Point of Pi (99999), the Atomic symbol for his work on the Manhattan Project, some of his life drawings, his artist name (Ofey), the Challenger disaster, and more... see if you can work them out!</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,richard-feynman-t-shirt,Richard Feynman,Richard Feynman,"<p>This t-shirt admires <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman"" target=""_blank"">Richard Feynman</a> , one of the world's best known scientists.

robert-h-goddard-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/space & aviation,Default Category/Science & Nature",base,Robert H. Goddard,"<p>This t-shirt admires the ""Father of Modern Rocketry"" - Robert H. Goddard.</p>
<p>Goddard, born in October 1882 in Massachusetts, USA became the first person in the world to build and launch a liquid-fueled rocket and Multi-stage rocket.<br /> Goddard had marvelous insight and knew the potential rocketry had, but was ridiculed and dismissed by many people during his lifetime.<br /> In an article by Goddard published in 1920 in the <em>New York Times</em> , he expressed his opinion that Rockets could one day reach the moon but was widely criticised and mocked. This resulted in Goddard continuing his work alone most of the time but he persevered and is now regarded as one of the most important figures in science history.</p>
<p>Admire him by wearing our Robert H. Goddard t-shirt, which shows his first patent submitted for multi-stage rocketry in 1914.</p>

rodin-v-bacon,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Arts & Culture,base,Rodin V Bacon,"<p>Francis Bacon is an artist who greatly influenced my work at art college and continues to influence my work today because of his almost disturbing interpretation of source imagery he collected, for example portraits, the human figure, meat.&nbsp; Auguste Rodin's sculptures of the human form greatly inspired Bacon's paintings and I thought it would be interesting to combine both artists' styles to create a dark and yet intrinsic piece.&nbsp; The design is inspired by Rodin's 'Flying Figure' (1890-1891) and Bacon's 'Figure with Meat' (1954).</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,rodin-v-bacon,Rodin V Bacon,Rodin V Bacon,<p>Rodin vs Bacon T shirt.
