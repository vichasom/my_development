periodic-table,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Science & Nature,base,Periodic Table,"<p>You have the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev to thank for this piece of work, probably among the most aesthetically pleasing representation of a scientific exegesis: The Periodic Table.</p>
<p>It is amazing to think&nbsp;that when the first generation of stars were formed, the only element available was hydrogen (a very boring periodic table that would have been). Huge amounts of gravitational pressure acting on the stars fused the hydrogen, turning it into helium... so then there were 2 elements.</p>
<p>This process continued, forming heavier &amp; heavier elements. The first 26 elements up to iron were formed via nucleosynthesis in the star cores, and some, due to their size&nbsp;would explode into a supernova, creating all elements heavier than iron.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,periodic-table,Periodic Table,Periodic Table,"<p>periodic table t shirt, Dmitri Mendeleev.

rappers,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Music,base,Rapper's Delight,"<p>'Officially' the first Hip-Hop record.&nbsp; Whether King Tim III (Personality Jock) by The Fatback Band came some weeks before may be argued to the end of time by enthusiasts of the genre, but it is the fact that Rapper's Delight was a hit that makes it the more likely candidate. I still to this day listen to the gargantuan 14 minute version of the song, and despite knowing the ironies of Big Bank Hank's claims to not 'bite' his rhymes when in fact he wholesaled them from Casanova Fly, to the point where he even spells the name out, and some of the more unusual later verses, all the elements of every hip hop tune ever since are present. From the brand name checking, the bragging of material wealth, the personal aggrandisement, the MC's irresistibility to women, the spelling of words, references to dancing and dance moves, support for your neighbourhood origins, the crew/gang affiliation, even the wholesale ""sampling"" of the hook from Chic's ""Good Times"", a practice that is the bedrock of the genre. Current megastars like Snoop Dogg or Jay-Z still interpolate the lyrics and Will Smith cites it as one of his most significant influences. It is certainly one of mine.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,rappers_delight,Rapper's Delight,Rapper's Delight,"<p>A T-shirt admiring the 'first' Hip Hop song, or in fact the first popular Hip Hop song: Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
