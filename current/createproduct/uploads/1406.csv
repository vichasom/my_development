TLR users would not have it any other way. In terms of timing the system is flexible at both extremes of the photographic process. The view of the shot is not interrupted by the movement of a mirror, so shots requiring a long exposure can be taken with greater flexibility and adjustment, while for similar reasons shots requiring speed can be composed and exposed more quickly because a heavy mirror does not have to be accelerated and shutter lag is minimised. </span></p>

This beauty and precision is matched by the work of Yukio Miyamoto. These images are created by Yukio in Adobe Creative Suite. To the front of this card you see one view of the finished artwork. As a background to this text you see a visual progress report sent to us by Yukio in the course of his work on these images. Man Ray gave us the quote: Creativity is divine, reproduction is human. Yukio's work transcends creativity and reproduction.
