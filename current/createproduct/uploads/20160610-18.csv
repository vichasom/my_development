riot-grrrl-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Popular Culture,base,Riot Grrrl,"<p><strong>Riot grrrl</strong> was an underground feminist punk movement that started in the early 1990s, and it is often associated with third-wave feminism (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). However, riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are Fifth Column, Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Jack Off Jill, Excuse 17, Heavens to Betsy, Huggy Bear, Adickdid, The Third Sex, Sleater-Kinney, and also lesbian queercore like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene, riot grrrl is also a subculture; zines, the DIY ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,riot-grrrl-t-shirt,Riot Grrrl,Riot Grrrl,"<p>Riot Grrrl, the punk feminists are celebrated here at weadmire.
