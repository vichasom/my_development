With a wingspan of nearly two metres (about five-and-a-half-feet) these magnificent creatures have brought themselves from the brink of extinction over the past 30 years, so they are worthy of admiration.&nbsp; All hail the glorious red kite. Wear this Red Kite T-shirt and show your admiration for this incredible creature.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,the-red-kite,Red Kite,Red Kite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
