<p>The design uses the title of a documentary made about Thompson in 1988 called&nbsp;<em>Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die,</em> &nbsp;which is a little ironic since Thompson&nbsp;committed&nbsp;suicide, aged 67 and his suicide note read:&nbsp;&quot;No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun &mdash; for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax &mdash; This won't hurt.&quot;</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,hunter-s-thompson-crazy-never-die-t-shirt,Hunter S. Thompson (Crazy Never Die),Hunter S.
