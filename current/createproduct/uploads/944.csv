He is known as the <em>""Father of English Geology""</em> for collating the geological history of England and Wales into a single record, although recognition was very slow in coming. At the time his map was first published he was overlooked by the scientific community; his relatively humble education and family connections preventing him from mixing easily in learned society. Consequently his work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only much later in his life that Smith received recognition for his accomplishments.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,william-smith-t-shirt,William Smith,William Smith,"<p>The Father of English Geology, Wiliiam 'Strata' Smith is justly celebrated here on this t shirt from weadmire.net.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
