There were 2 spacecraft (Voyager 1 &amp; 2) which were both launched in 1977. The main objective of the mission was to study Saturn &amp; Jupiter, but they surpassed all expectations and kept operational through the outer solar system, studying the outer planets too. They are currently heading toward the Ort cloud and eventually will leave our system and carry on basically &quot;forever&quot;... this leaves the possibility of them one day being found by another intelligent civilisation, somewhere out there however long it may take. Because of this, both spacecraft carried &quot;messages&quot; on golden records to whoever or whatever may one day find them. The record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, along with symbolic directions for playing the record and data detailing the location of Earth. The record is intended as a combination time capsule&nbsp;and interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that recovers either of the&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em> &nbsp;craft. The contents of this record were selected by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>I admire not only the technological effort put into this program, but also the&nbsp;foresight&nbsp;and hope that one day the spacecraft could be found by extra terrestrial beings.. very cool.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,voyager-t-shirt,Voyager,Voyager,"<p>A t shirt celebrating the Voyager space program, and rightly so.
