<p>Hedy Lamarr, gorgeous, headstrong, mathematically gifted and very inventive. My mother was a fan. Her parents were Jewish Austrians. Her first husband, the very wealthy owner/director of an inherited munitions business, 13 years her senior, apparently found himself out of his emotional depth quite quickly to the point of making her a virtual prisoner. Rarely out of his sight she was a party to conversations between him and his engineers that included discussions about the radio control of torpedoes. Among other things his business manufactured torpedoes for the German Navy. One of the vexing problems for her husband and his engineers was the matter of how to avoid jamming of said radio control. Ms Lamarr's inadequate husband and his engineers being sure radio jamming by the British and American Navies would follow hard on the heels of any radio control.</p>
<p>It is said in order to escape, she drugged her husband. And it is a matter of record that she divorced him in Paris in 1937 before coming to London where she met Louis B Meyer of MGM. He gave her a film studio contract and the name Hedy Lamarr and took her to Hollywood. There she met and had an affair with a pianist George Anthiel. He showed her a pianola, an automated piano, and she saw what needed to be done to make radio transmissions to torpedoes and anything else unjammable. The patent for packet switching/ frequency hopping, was granted to Antheil and Hedy Kiesler Markey On August 11, 1942, US patent 2,292382. This is a key empirical component in the working of cellular/mobile phones to this day.

humprey-bogart-posters,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Film,base,Humphrey Bogart - Posters,"<p>One of my recent joys was introducing my wife to the film Casablanca. It was entertaining to listen to her amazement at how many quotes she knew and all from a single film. Bogey was a man's man, with the good sense to marry one of Hollywoods truly great women, Lauren Bacall. Despite his being mainly associated with the ubiquitous private detective character, it's films like Key Largo,&nbsp; the Treasure of Sierra Madre and The African Queen that have stayed with me. With upwards of 70 films under his belt and ranked, in 1999, as The Greatest Male Star of all Time, it's not difficult to admire the man and his work.</p>",,,0,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,humprey-bogart-posters-T-Shirt,Humphrey Bogart - Posters,Humphrey Bogart - Posters,<p>Humphrey Bogart posters in Bogarts silhouette.
