christopher-marlowe,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,base,Christopher Marlowe,"<p><strong>For the secret conspiracy theorists in all of us, the idea that </strong><strong>Christopher Marlowe </strong><strong> faked his own death, only to continue writing under his new name of William Shakespeare, has a certain appeal. After all, no one really knows what Shakespeare looked like. Accused of blasphemy, libel and of being a spy. Marlowe's&nbsp; life, it seems, was as dramatic as the plays he both wrote and allegedly wrote.<br /><br />This design plays with the idea of that conspiracy, whilst puckishly inverting it.</strong></p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,christopher-marlowe,Christopher Marlowe,Christopher Marlowe,"<p><strong>Christopher Marlowe</strong> as poet and playwright was at the forefront of the 16th Century dramatic renaissance, a man to whom Shakespeare and others owe a huge debt of gratitude.

dino-yukio-miyamoto-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,Dino (Yukio Miyamoto),"<p>This design admires the Dino, produced between 1968 and 1976.</p>
<p>Built by Ferrari, but not officially badged as a Ferrari, the Dino was a beautiful little sports car with a V6 engine rather than the standard 12 cylinder engines that Ferrari were then famous for.</p>
<p>The Dino engine was designed by Enzo's son, Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot; Ferrari.</p>
<p>It was basically an attempt by Ferrari to produce a smaller, lighter and ultimately cheaper car that could compete with relatively cheaper Porsches that were outselling the more expensive Ferrari's.</p>
<p>Enzo was unsure of this idea, but was willing to give it a go, as long as it didn't tarnish the Ferrari reputation, hence the different name.</p>

donna-summer-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Music,base,Donna Summer,"<p>Donna Summer - Disco is a derided era in music history when it presided over a period of escapism and much happiness and self expression for many people, and the music that accompanied it is the sound to so much liberation. Sexual, racial, physical, creative, gender. There are a few who would claim the crown of The Queen of Disco but as far as I am concerned only one to ever actually sit on the throne. When Donna summer sings ""Love to Love you baby"", your mind warps to a Studio 54 night, a decadent time and a total belief that she absolutely means it.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,donna-summer-t-shirt,Donna Summer,Donna Summer,"<p>The Queen of Disco, Donna Summer is celebrated here in this fabulous t-shirt from We Admire.net</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
