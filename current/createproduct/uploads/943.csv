He was fascinated with astronomy, but unhappy with the lack of accuracy in the astonomical measurements at the time (this was before telescopes were invented) so he dedicated his life to studying and observing the stars &amp; planets. He setup the world's first full-time observatory on the island of Hven near Denmark and then in Prague after being invited there by the king. He was a great observer and recorded planetary positions that were ten times more accurate than anyone before him had achieved.</p>
<p>His observations were so accurate in fact that Kepler was able to devise his three laws of planetary motion using Brahe's calculations:</p>
<p>1. The planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at a focus point.</p>
<p>2. In their orbits, the planets sweep out equal area's in equal times.</p>
<p>3. The square of the time taken to complete one orbit is proportional to the cube of the average orbital distance from the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the laws that Newton was able to use to establish universal gravitation, therefore, Tycho can be thought of as the seed that started modern astronomy and should be admired for it!</p>
<p>I admire <a title=""Tycho Brahe"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe"">Tycho</a> &rsquo;s reputation of being the first true ""modern"" astronomer, but also for being a bit of a party animal! He loved a drink, and subsequently lost the end of his nose after a heavy drinking session, an argument and a duel... a proper duel with a broadsword in the dark!</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,tycho-brahe-t-shirt-1,Tycho Brahe,Tycho Brahe,"<p>This design admires Tycho Brahe, one of the first true astronomers.
