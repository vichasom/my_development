<p><br />Tom Waits to me, is like the barker standing outside a freak show in the American middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><br />He invites you to come inside and marvel at the oddities on display. Each one is an aspect of his life; a thought he had on the way to somewhere else, a memory from his childhood, a feeling, someone he used to know. The freaks are his songs, and his songs are himself.</p>
<p>""Somebody once said I'm not a musician but a tonal engineer. I like that, Its kind of clinical and primitive at the same time.""</p>
<p><br />I think this quote sums up Waits completely. His style is well honed and skilled, but the delivery is like getting smashed in the skull with a blunt instrument. He is also like an 18th century Barber Surgeon. He knows exactly what he's doing, but he doesn't wash his hands before he operates.</p>
<p><br />This is a good one too:<br /><br />""I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy""</p>
