<p>The Lotus 38 was built to win the 1965 Indianapolis 500 and driven to victory by Jim Clark. You will see the car was build with asymmetric suspension designed to race anti clockwise oval tracks. Jim Clark qualified in 2nd place to AJ Foyt but took the lead on the first lap. He relinquished the lead briefly twice but otherwise led the race for 190 laps, a record. 1965 was the first time a rear engined car won the Indy 500. History was made, front engined cars had won every race up to 1965 but were never to win the race again. Jim Clark missed the Monaco GP to compete in the Indianapolis 500 and became the only man to win the F1 World Championship and the Indy 500 in the same year.</p>
<p><br />The car illustrated on this t-shirt by Peter Hutton was the car raced by Jim Clark, it was the first Lotus 38 built and has recently been restored to running condition by Classic Team Lotus and Ford. It is owned by the Ford Museum Dearborn.</p>
<p><br />We digitised the original watercolour artwork at about 2000 dpi. The artwork is in full CMYK colour and is dyed into the fabric of the t-shirt at 1440 dpi.
