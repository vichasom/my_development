fly-fisherman,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Sports,Default Category/Fishing",base,Fly Fisherman,"<p>It is said by many that Claudius Aelianus first recorded the use of an artificial fly, cast with a rod and line, by Macedonian fisherman on the Astraeus River.<br /> <br /> <em>...they have planned a snare for the fish, and get the better of them by their fisherman's craft. . . . They fasten red . . . wool round a hook, and fit on to the wool two feathers which grow under a cock's wattles, and which in color are like wax. Their rod is six feet long, and their line is the same length. Then they throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and maddened by the color, comes straight at it, thinking from the pretty sight to gain a dainty mouthful; when, however, it opens its jaws, it is caught by the hook, and enjoys a bitter repast, a captive.<br /> </em> <br /> Since then, little has changed, it seems. Technology may have been refined, along with the manufacture of the '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_fishing"">fly</a> ', but it essentially remains the same today as it has done for the better part of two thousand years and probably more. Some things, i suppose, are invented the best that they can be right from the start.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,fly-fisherman,Fly Fisherman,Fly Fisherman,"<p>A t-shirt celebrating fly-fishing, from weadmire.net.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>Starting as far back as 1894, ""Grand Prix"" racing turned officially into 'Formula One' in 1950. Grand Prix Racing/<a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/f1-world-champions-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">F1</a> has tested the best drivers, designers and mechanics the world has had to offer.<br /> Greats such as Moss, <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/juan-manuel-fangio-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">Fangio</a>, Surtees, Ascari, <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/sir-jack-brabham-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">Brabham</a>, Mansell, Prost, Senna &amp; Schumacher have all competed in Grands Prix over the years, and have become globally known and admired by millions of fans.</p>
<p>Designers/engineers such as <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/keith-duckworth-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">Duckworth</a>, Uhlenhault, Dudot, Wright, Barnard, Byrne &amp; <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/adrian-newey-addicted-to-aero-t-shirts/"" target=""_blank"">Adrian Newey</a> have all contributed to F1 by making the cars faster and more efficient, steadily evolving the cars, creating many things that have transferred into the general automotive industry.</p>
<p>I love the fact that it is the very top level of racing featuring the world's <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/f1-world-champions-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">fastest drivers</a> in the world's fastest, most expensive and most technically advanced cars on the planet - huge amounts of money is spent on research and development by the teams, and the effort put into research rivals that of companies in the aviation and defense industries!</p>
<p>Money, Speed, Advanced Technology and Glamour. F1 has it all.</p>
<p>I am extremely passionate about Formula One, and haven't missed a race in almost 20 years. I guess you could say I am almost obsessed with it! My t-shirt design shows a very technical drawing of a recent <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/ferrari-flat-12-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">Ferrari</a> F1 car and a red glow representing the 'soul', or the life of the car.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,formula-one-t-shirt,Formula One,Formula One,<p>Wear this t-shirt to admire all the great F1 circuits of the modern era.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appearing in 73 films in a career that spanned 6 decades and 5 husbands, she was one of Hollywoods early feminist, a staunch anti-Communist... oh, and a bit of a dancer, as our youtube link will testify. Like so many of the women of her day, she blazed a path for actresses throughout the century, campaigning for better scripts and pay for women.<br /> <br /> She died at the age of 83 in Rancho Mirage in April 1995.</p>",,,0,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,ginger-rogers,Ginger Rogers,Ginger Rogers,<p>Ginger Rogers t shirt.
