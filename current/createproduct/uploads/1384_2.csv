<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an enduring appeal in beautifully made objects where function is an overriding consideration but where attention to detail, uncompromising quality, precise manufacture and obsessive commitment in design elevates the object into something with durability and profound appeal. Typically these objects have the quality of &ldquo;nothing superfluous and nothing missing.&rdquo; There is similarly profound appeal in owning and wearing work the quality of which is singular. Here we have one of four examples of beautiful functional objects beautifully simulated and reproduced by Yukio Miyamoto in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leica had been producing the world's best 35mm camera for some time before they gave us the IIIf, but 60 years or so on if you had one you would still cherish it and it would still be taking perfect photographs. Yukio Miyamoto's work in simulating effects like the light refraction in the lens coating might be taken for granted for being so visually familiar but to see the work needed to achieve it here is to be amazed, it is exquisitely precise. These cameras never let their owners down and consistently exceeded their expectations. Yukio's simulation, which is entirely scaleable without loss of resolution, has a partial 3D visual quality that is not lost when reproduced on a t shirt. It has a super realistic feel to it that subtly lets viewers know they are not looking at a photograph. Yukio is probably the world's most accomplished user of the Adobe gradient mesh tool. To view the Adobe Illustrator file and lift the layers of illustrative fill to get to the basic line drawing that is printed on the reverse of the shirt is astonishing. This is art and craftsmanship of the highest order. Printed front and rear. Can be personalised with a name or thumbnail image for no extra charge. Please email us to complete this detail.</p>
