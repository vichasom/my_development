shakespeare-twelfth-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,Default Category/History & Politics",base,Shakespeare (Twelfth),"<p>This T-shirt design honors William Shakespeare who is without a doubt (in my mind) the most influential and talented writer that ever lived. Born over 450 years ago, William Shakespeare produced more than 35 plays, many of which are still famous today. He was extraordinary at introducing new words &amp; phrases into the English language with thousands of words and phrases credited to Shakespeare that have no written references before he had penned them. There are many quotes from shakespeare's plays and I have chosen my favourites to form a series dedicated to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 23 designs in this series.<br /> Here are the plays I have chosen, (click on the name of the play to see that design):<br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-all-s-well-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; All's Well That Ends Well</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-antony-cleo-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Antony &amp; Cleopatra</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-as-you-like-it-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; As You Like It</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-comedy-of-errors-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Comedy Of Errors</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-hamlet-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Hamlet</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-henryv-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Henry V</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-julius-caesar-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Julius Caesar</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-king-lear-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; King Lear</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-labours-lost-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Loves Labours Lost</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-macbeth-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Macbeth</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-measure-for-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Measure For Measure</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-merchant-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; The Merchant of Venice</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-merry-wives-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Merry Wives of Windsor</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-midsummer-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Midsummer Nights Dream</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-much-ado-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Much Ado About Nothing</a> <br /> &bull;&nbsp;<a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-othello-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">Othello</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-richard-ii-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Richard II</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-richard-iii-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Richard III</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-romeo-juliet-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Romeo &amp; Juliet&nbsp;</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-taming-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Taming Of The Shrew</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-tempest-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; The Tempest</a> <br /> <a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-twelfth-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&bull; Twelfth Night</a> <br /> <br /> The main design features the&nbsp;<a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-the-globe-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">Globe theatre</a> &nbsp;and the quote<a href=""/tshirt/shakespeare-the-globe-t-shirt"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;&quot;The Worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players.

sir-edmund-hillary,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/History & Politics,Default Category/Popular Culture",base,Edmund Hillary,"<p>This t-shirt design admires Sir Edmund Hillary, Born in New Zealand in 1919, Hillary went on to become the first ever person to reach the summit of Mount Everest along with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay on 29th May 1953.</p>
<p>Ten years before that historic day, Hillary was in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, where he served as a navigator on Catalina flying boats.</p>
<p>He was badly burnt in a boating accident, after which he was repatriated to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Edmund then took part in a reconnaissance mission to Everest in 1951 with Eric Shipton before returning 12 months later for his successful attempt with Tenzing.<br /> <br /> The first words Hillary said to his good friend George Lowe after reaching the summit were: &quot;Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.&quot; - I like this quote... it's not something you would hve expected him to say, and something that reminds us that, although a giant and courageous man, he was still very human and very down to earth.</p>
<p>The crest behind him is the 'Arms of Edmund Hillary' - made for the Hillary family after he reached the summit.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,sir-edmund-hillary,Edmund Hillary,Edmund Hillary,"<p>This t-shirt design admires Sir Edmund Hillary, Born in New Zealand in 1919, Hillary went on to become the first ever person to reach the summit of Mount Everest along with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay on 29th May 1953.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sir-francis-drake-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/History & Politics,Default Category/History,Default Category/politics",base,Sir Francis Drake,"<p>This t-shirt design admires the legendary Sir Francis Drake.</p>
<p>Born in Devon, Uk in early 1540, Francis Drake went on to become Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy and was second in command of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588.</p>
<p>Before this though, Drake&nbsp;was chosen as the leader of an expedition intended to pass around South America through the Strait of Magellan&nbsp;and to explore the coast that lay beyond. The expedition was backed by the Queen&nbsp;herself. He had official approval to benefit himself and&nbsp;the queen, as well as to cause the maximum damage to the Spaniards.</p>
<p>He certainly succeeded at this,&nbsp;He seized provisions at Valpara&iacute;so, attacked passing Spanish merchantmen, and captured two very rich prizes that were carrying bars of gold and silver, minted Spanish coinage, precious stones, and pearls.</p>
<p>The Spanish were taken by surprise but thought that Drake, like all other captains of the time would return to England the same way he had come, so waited to attack him on his return - but Drake had other idea's and decided to keep sailing, eventually he sighted Asia and continued on until he reached home, becoming the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.</p>
<p>On September 26, 1580, Francis Drake took his ship into Plymouth Harbour. She was laden with treasure and spices, and Drake's fortune was permanently made. Despite Spanish protests about his piratical conduct while in their imperial waters, Queen Elizabeth herself went aboard the&nbsp;<em>Golden Hind</em> , which was lying at Deptford in the Thames estuary, and personally bestowed knighthood on him.</p>
<p>Loved by the English, but feared by the Spanish - he was given the nickname &quot;El Draque&quot; - &quot;The Dragon&quot; in Spanish. I have used this in my design with his ship the Golden Hind (previously called the Pelican) in the crest and a portrait of Drake on a gold coin, representing the fortune he made for himself and England.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,sir-francis-drake-t-shirt,Sir Francis Drake,Sir Francis Drake,"<p>This t-shirt design admires the legendary Sir Francis Drake.
