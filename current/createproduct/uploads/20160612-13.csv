great-equations-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Science & Nature,base,Great Equations,"<p>This t-shirt design admires some of the greatest equations the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>There have been many great equations, but here are seven of the most influential ones (in no particular order):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Newtons second law of motion (force applied to an object is it's mass x acceleration).</p>
<p>The basis of most practical engineering mechanics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Archimedes calculation of Pi - Pi has been around for a very long time, even before Archimedes, but it</p>
<p>was he who narrowed it down to an acceptable value. Pi is used in so many things, from shoe size distribution</p>
<p>to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle... important!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Everybody knows about Einstein's most famous equation that states ""Energy is equal to an objects mass x the speed of light"" although the famous equation deals with mass at rest, the equation in our design is the</p>
<p>less known but much more important (yet difficult to calculate) mass in motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Maxwell's beautiful equation that united electricity and magnetism among other things. Not bad!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Dirac's Equation. Paul Dirac can be thanked for many equations, but this is the relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation which provides a description of elementary spin particles such as electrons. This is the equation that demanded the existence of antiparticles and actually predated their experimental discovery, making the discovery of the positron, the antiparticle of the electron which is one of the greatest triumphs of modern theoretical physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Fermats ""Little"" Theorem - Fermats ""Last"" theorem gets a lot of attention, but this little theorem is the one that does all the work. Basically it states that if you take any number and raise it to the power of p -1, where p is prime, the result will be one more than a multiple of p, which with a small tweak and much bigger numbers, enables anyone to encode data. This is one of the backbones of the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Last but not least, Euler's equation that uses the five fundamental constants of mathematics.. this is what mathematicians mean when they talk about beauty.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,great-equations-t-shirt,Great Equations,Great Equations,<p>This t-shirt design admires some of the greatest equations the world has ever seen.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column
hardy-reels,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Sports,Default Category/Fishing",base,Hardy Reels,"<p>Since 1891, when the first Hardy 'Perfect' reel was produced, the name has been synonymous with quality fishing equipment. Having started out as gunsmiths, William Hardy soon allowed his passion for fishing to dictate the direction of his company, that has resulted in royal patronage, holder of the first American Kudos Award for Excellence and 5 Japanese Industrial Design awards.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,hardy-reels,Hardy Reels,Hardy Reels,"<p>A t-shirt celebrating the fishing reels of Hardy, arguably the finest out there.

headphones-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Music,Default Category/Design & Architecture,Default Category/Arts & Culture,Default Category/Popular Culture",base,Headphones,"<p>This t-shirt design admires the humble product we call Headphones. Almost all of us own at least one pair of headphones but rarely stop and think how marvelous they are.</p>
<p>The first headphones intended for sale to the public appeared around 1930 courtesy of&nbsp;<a href=""http://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Beyerdynamic</a>, but it wasn't until 1957 when&nbsp;Jazz musician John C. Koss invented stereo headphones&mdash;that is, headphones providing a &ldquo;full amplitude&rdquo; of sound.</p>
<p>I love my headphones and couldn't live without them, so I created this t-shirt design. I drew the headphones in Adobe Illustrator, and based it on a modern pair of top-end headphones by Bayerdynamic, the company that led the way for headphones.</p>
