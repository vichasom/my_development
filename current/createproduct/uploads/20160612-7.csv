Before his arrival Liverpool languished in the second division. After his departure they have never finished in the bottom half of the top flight. Instilling a level of belief not just in his players but in the community and the city of Liverpool as a whole he, along with four lads who formed a band can be held single handedly responsible for restoring a pride and passion to the city that it had long been without. His mantra of pass and move is still basic to all players at the club yet highly effective in its simplicity, and his instigation of training regimes was revolutionary literally at the ground level. But it is his wider stature in the game from his inspirational and inciteful quotations and philosophy on the game that have made him rightly a towering figure. After retirement he said&nbsp; ""I was only in the game for the love of football - and I wanted to bring back happiness to the people of Liverpool.""

bob-dylan-accoustic,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Music,base,Bob Dylan - Acoustic,"<p>The lyrics that form the outline of the Martin Dreadnought in this t shirt design are my favourite acoustic Dylan songs.&nbsp; We would interested in hearing about your favourite Dylan songs <br /> <br /> Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &lsquo;acoustic years&rsquo; spanned his &lsquo;wandering troubadour&rsquo; fantasy, fuelled by his reading of Woody Gutherie&rsquo;s Bound for Glory. Early songs such as &lsquo;Hard Times in New York&rsquo; romantically recounting the moment he first rocked up in New York aged 20, looked up at the Rockerfeller building and knew in that instant that the city would be a great teacher and help him formalise his undoubtable natural talent for song writing. Dylan&rsquo;s ability to send his listeners to another world is where my admiration for him really began. In this early period of works, such as &lsquo;Boots of Spanish Leather&rsquo; you can switch the lights off, turn up the record and immediately be projected to the centre of a strained farewell between two lovers, one of whom is travelling to a far off land. He was frighteningly confident and commanding with a guitar and words at such a young age, in a way which I still find hard to comprehend.<br /> <br /> Please demonstrate you appreciation of Bob Dylan with our t shirts.</p>

The group of around twenty then boarded a bus , often driven by Dylan himself, and began the crazed frenzy of a tour that was the &lsquo;Rolling Thunder Review&rsquo; in which they explored North America and Canada, playing impromptu gigs to bemused local crowds whom had just planned to hit their local for a beer or two. Songs from the fantastic album &lsquo;Desire&rsquo; were previewed, and amongst other notable happenings Dylan and Alan Ginsberg visited Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s grave, and Dylan met Rubin Carter in jail, the boxer wrongly accused or an armed robbery, who was the subject of &lsquo;The Hurricaine&rsquo;.<br /> <br /> Fantastically this surreal episode was caught on camera in a loosely scripted film &lsquo;Renaldo &amp; Clara&rsquo;, a must see for any true Dylan fan.<br /> <br /> Please demonstrate you appreciation of Bob Dylan with our t shirts.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,bob-dylan-telecaster,Bob Dylan - Telecaster,Bob Dylan - Telecaster,<p>Bob Dylan Telecaster t shirt.

brabham-bt20-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,Brabham BT20,"<p>This design admires the double world championship winning Brabham BT20 and Sir Jack Brabham.&nbsp; <br /> <a href=""http://www.jackbrabham.com/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Brabham</a> won his third drivers title in 1966 driving the BT19 &amp; BT20, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name. Then, the following year the title went to Brabham's team mate, Kiwi <a href=""http://www.mclarenmotorsport.co.nz/dennyhulme.html"" target=""_blank"">Denny Hulme</a> . The Brabham team took the constructors' world championship in both years, with the BT20 being used in both seasons (the latter part of 66 and early part of 67).</p>
<p>I particulary liked this image, Sir Jack Brabham looks as if it's merely another day at the office.&nbsp; The tyres testify otherwise:&nbsp; the near side rear left is struggling to stay on its rim and the off side right is doing the same.&nbsp; They are grooved, they might be cross plys,&nbsp; and there's no down force, the car has a space frame chassis and about 400bhp.&nbsp; A handfull in any circumstance but apparently not a problem.</p>
<p>A beautiful car, the <a href=""http://www.f1technical.net/f1db/cars/197"" target=""_blank"">BT20</a> is what motor racing was all about before money became the top priority.<br /> Admire the 1966 &amp; 1967 championship winning car and Sir jack Braham, wear our t shirt.<br /></p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,brabham-bt20-t-shirt,Brabham BT20,Brabham BT20,<p>This design admires the double world championship winning Brabham BT20 and Sir Jack Brabham.&nbsp,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
