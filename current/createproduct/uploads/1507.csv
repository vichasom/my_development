<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lotus was originally powered by a 998cc <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/cosworth-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">Cosworth engine</a> to contest the Formula 2 Championship, which it won driven by Jim Clark.&nbsp; At the end of the 1964 season the car was modified to become the 32B powered by a 2495cc Coventry Climax 4 cylinder in order to compete in the Tasman series of races held in Australia and New Zealand during the northern hemisphere's winter racing close season- January to early March.&nbsp; <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/jim-clark/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Clark</a> was completely dominant in the 32B winning nine of the races.&nbsp; Having won the Tasman series in 1965 Clark went on to win The Formula 1 World Championship, The British and French Formula 2 Championships, and <a href=""http://weadmire.net/tshirt/indy-500-t-shirt/"" target=""_blank"">The Indianapolis 500</a>.&nbsp; This extraordinary haul of Championships in a single year will never be repeated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drawing is the work of Peter Hutton. The original artwork is an exquisite watercolour which perfectly catches and matches the delicate proportions of the car. We scan Peter's originals at very high resolution so they can be enlarged with no loss of detail and placed on our t-shirts. The decoration on the fabric of the t-shirt is fully coloured and fully colour fast.</p>
