<p>Apart from being recreational and to some extent a means of transport I think <a href=""http://skateboarding.transworld.net/"" target=""_blank"">skateboarding</a> is an interesting demonstration of the pains and pleasures of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"" target=""_blank"" title=""testosterone"">testosterone</a> . A 2002 report by American Sports Data found that there were 18.5 million <a href=""http://www.missiong.com/video/No-Place-Like-Home"" target=""_blank"">skateboarders</a> in the world. 85 percent of skateboarders polled who had used a board in the last year were under the age of 18, and 74 percent were male. Given the level of skill and the risks taken to both acquire and demonstrate its acquisition the motivation has got to be pretty fundamental.</p>

<p>There is a flight of steps beside the river <a name=""Thames"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames"">Thames</a> , part of <a name=""The Queen's Walk"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Walk"">The Queen's Walk</a> , that takes pedestrians to and from the riverside footpath at the south eastern end of <a name=""London Bridge"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge"">London Bridge</a> . The drop from top to bottom of these steps is probably about 12 meters in two flights. The slope is greater than 30%. The steps are faced in pink polished granite to match the facade of the adjacent building and the lower flight is <a name=""set at an angle to the bannister"" href=""http://drop.io/weadmire1/asset/dsc03372-jpg-2"">set at an angle to the bannister</a> . The steps are narrow and much steeper than might be expected for busy steps on a public footpath. There is a polished stainless steel banister that runs down the middle of these steps. Why should you be interested? This hand rail is covered in the tell tale scratches caused by the undersides of countless boards and inline skates. How many shoulders, arms and legs have been broken in the cause of mastering this banister? I can imagine quite a few.
