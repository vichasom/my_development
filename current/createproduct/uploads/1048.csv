<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bird gets it and there is hell to pay in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'And I had done an hellish thing,</p>
<p>And it would work 'em woe:</p>
<p>For all averred, I had killed the bird</p>
<p>That made the breeze to blow.</p>
<p>Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,</p>
<p>That made the breeze to blow!'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Ah! wel-a-day! what evil looks</p>
<p>Had I from old and young!</p>
<p>Instead of the cross, the albatross</p>
<p>About my neck was hung.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punished by his fellow sailors for killing the albatross, the mariner is forced to wear the dead bird round his neck as penance for his evil deed.&nbsp;</p>
