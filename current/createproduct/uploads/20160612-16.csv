nikon-f3ma-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Design & Architecture,Default Category/Photography,Default Category/Popular Culture",base,Nikon F3MA (Yukio Miyamoto),"<p>This t-shirt design admires one of the last 35mm film SLR's, Nikon's F3MA.</p>
<p>During the mid 1990s, the popular but discontinued Nikon FE-2 had begun to skyrocket in value on the secondhand market. Nikon responded to this phenomenon with the FM3A.</p>
<p>The FM3A's expensive construction and conservative design were not intended to appeal to the consumer-level market. Nikon instead marketed the camera to serious amateur and professional photographers who were desirous of the highest possible quality and precision of control, and a service life estimated not in years, but decades.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the introduction of the FM3A coincided with the &quot;digital camera&quot; revolution so many would be customers decided to try the much cheaper although less reliable digital camera's.</p>
<p>We admire the FM3A, because of it's extremely high quality components and its reliability in day-to-day use. It may have come onto the market at a difficult time for 35mm film camera's, but it is still a fantastic piece of design.</p>

pepi-bican-417-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Sports,base,Pepi Bican (417),"<p>This T-Shirt is to celebrate Josef &quot;Pepi&quot; Bican&rsquo;s (1913-2001) 417 offical league goals he managed to score when wearing the &bdquo;stitched&ldquo; red and white shirt with a star (representing the heart every Slavia Prag player should be prepared to give for his team during the game). The idea is to stress that it would take an army of players these days to score that many goals for a single team. Nowadays, I can hardly imagine anybody scoring 57 goals in a single season as Pepi Bican did (1943-44). His statistics are overwhelming one could just go on and on...</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,pepi-bican-417-t-shirt,Pepi Bican (417),Pepi Bican (417),"<p>Nowadays, I can hardly imagine anybody scoring 57 goals in a single season as Pepi Bican did (1943-44).
