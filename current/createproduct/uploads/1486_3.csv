<p><br />I try to avoid the clich&eacute;s that surround conversations about music of the late 50's, 60's and early 70's.&nbsp; I worry the general opinion music from those 30 years or so is vastly superior is a generational thing.&nbsp; But no matter how hard I try I do not seem to be able to get away from the fact on any absolute scale of spontaneity, quality and diversity nothing since has come close.&nbsp; And anything that has likely has its roots and inspiration in that period.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />There is evidence this opinion is widely held in the prices of tickets to see the likes of Cream in 2005 and more recently the Rolling Stones in their upcoming tour, not to mention Led Zeppelin at the O2 in Greenwich a couple of years ago.&nbsp; If great music acts were not so common place surely the prices would have been higher then.&nbsp; I bought some Stones tickets for the Big Apple in Brighton in 1971 at 18/- (90p).&nbsp; I understand the ante now is about ???400 , a multiple of about 450, that out performs all other measures of price inflation in the UK by some way.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Through a series of playbills we admire an unrivalled period in music that made whole populations resonate and at quite extraordinary prices.&nbsp; What price&nbsp; Cream, Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Gino Washington, The Move, Zoot Money at the O2 now? You will see they were yours in Spalding Lincolnshire for ???1 on May 29th 1967....<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />We reproduce the artwork on the t-shirt at 720 dpi in full CMYK colour.&nbsp; We can bleed the poster off the shoulders and to the bottom hem of the t-shirt because the technique dyes the fabric rather than printing it.&nbsp; The process does not effect the performance or feel of the t-shirt fabric &ndash; this t-shirt will be as comfortable as it would be if it were not decorated<br />&nbsp;</p>
