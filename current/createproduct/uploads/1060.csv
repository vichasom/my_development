<p>Clough was a decent footballer back in the day. He made 274 appearances and scored 251 goals mainly with his home side Middlesborough and then with Sunderland.</p>
<p>All was going well until a match against Bury in 1962,&nbsp; Clough collided with the Bury keeper and was stretchered off. The injury turned out to be a torn cruciate ligament, signalling the end of his playing career.</p>
<p>It wasn't his playing career that he is remembered for however, but his managing career.<br /> Starting with Hartpools United at the age of 30, Clough was the youngest manager in the league.<br /> The next team Clough managed was Derby County, taking them on to win both the League Championship and the Second Division League.<br /> He then managed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and then Leeds without much success, but the next team he managed, Nottingham Forest was the pinnacle of his career.<br /> Honours Clough achieved at Nottingham include two European Cups (1979 &amp; 1980), Winning the European Super Cup, League Champions in 1977/78 &amp; 1978/79, FA Charity Shield winners in 1978 and League Cup Champions four times (1978, 79, 89 &amp; 90)!</p>
<p>Clough was universally seen as a hard but fair manager, who insisted on clean play from his players. He was famous for insisting on being called 'Mr Clough' and earned great respect from his peers for his ability to turn a game to his and his team's advantage.</p>
<p>Such was his popularity, fans of Derby County and Nottingham Forest, usually the fiercest of rivals, mourned together following his passing in 2004 aged 69.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,brian-clough-t-shirt,Brian Clough,Brian Clough,"<p>Brian Clough, the best manager England did not have.&nbsp; Celebrate a great manager with our Brian Clough t shirt.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
