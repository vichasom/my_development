marcel-duchamp-t-shirt-1,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Arts & Culture,base,Marcel Duchamp,"<p>Marcel Duchamp was a controversial and very influential artist of the early 20th century. He began painting in the style of Fauvism, he then moved into experimentational Avante Garde with peices like Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2 (featured in this design), and began his 'ready-mades' sculptures, which consisted of household items such as the famous peice, Fountain, which was a signed urinal. The peice shattered artistic traditions, questioning and blurring the lines of artisanship and concept in art.<br /> Duchamp helped change the course of art and played a crucial role in the development of Dada, Surrealism and Pop art.<br /> <br /> His peices, Portrait of Dr. Dumouchel, and Self Portrait in Profile can also be seen in the design</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,marcel-duchamp-t-shirt-1,Marcel Duchamp,Marcel Duchamp,"<p>Creator of L.H.O.O.Q, the urinal and many other surreal and witty art pieces, Marcel Duchamp is admired here at weadmire.net.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
