<p>This t-shirt design admires the Formula One triple World Champion, Sir Jack Brabham.<br /> Sir Jack wasn't just a great F1 driver, he was also mechanically and technically gifted - He not only won the F1 World Championship three times, but he won it in a car bearing his own name - something that will probably never be repeated...imagine Lewis Hamilton winning a world championship for the Hamilton-Mercedes Team!</p>
<p>Brabham initially raced for <a href=""http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/cooper_car_co.htm"" target=""_blank"">Cooper Car Company</a> (He won two World Championships for Cooper in 1959 &amp; 1960), but also owned his own car dealership which sold ""upgraded"" road cars with the engineering help of his friend <a href=""http://rontauranac.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Ron Tauranac</a>. <br /> Sir Jack &amp; Ron had dreamt of creating their own racing cars, and in the mid 60's when Cooper started to lose their form, they started Brabham Racing Organisation.</p>
<p>It started out like most other small teams in F1 without much success, but in 1966 a new 3-litre formula was created for Formula One. The new engines under development by other suppliers all had at least 12 cylinders and proved difficult to develop.</p>
<p>Brabham took a different approach and asked Repco to develop a 3-litre V8 for them. Although it was less powerful than their competitor's 12 cylinder powerplants, the Repco was light and more importantly, reliable.</p>
<p>On July 3rd, 1966, Jack won the French Grand Prix in the <a href=""http://www.f1technical.net/f1db/cars/196/brabham-bt19"" target=""_blank"">Brabham BT19</a>. He went on to win the next four races, the British, Dutch &amp; German Grands Prix and secured the 1966 World Championship in his own car.</p>
<p>A key part of the art work for this t-shirt design was produced by <a href=""http://www.automotiveillustrations.com/illustrators/vector-illustrator-miyamoto.html"" target=""_blank"">Yukio Miyamoto</a> and is endorsed by Sir Jack Brabham himself.&nbsp; It is a detailed Adobe Illustrator drawing with a profile of Jack in the background from his earlier days (around 1960) along with his signature.<br /> The t-shirt features printing on the front and the back and is a special edition t-shirt.<br /> The cost of this t-shirt design is &pound;40. 7.5% of the gross sale price of each shirt is donated to Sir jack Brabham's&nbsp; Charity, <a href=""http://www.kidney.org.au/"" target=""_blank"">Kidney Health Australia</a>.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,jack-brabham-bt19-t-shirt,Sir Jack Brabham & BT19 (Yukio Miyamoto),Sir Jack Brabham & BT19 (Yukio Miyamoto),"<p>Among other great achievements, Jack Brabham was also the first man to win a Formula One world championship in a car of his own construction, which I think is amazing and something which will probably never be repeated.
