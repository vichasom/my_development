300-slr,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,1955 Mercedes 300SLR,"<p>An absolutely stunning motorcar. The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SLR evokes both triumph &amp; tragedy, winning the 1955 World Sportscar Championship with victories in Germany, Sweden, Ireland and at the Targa Florio&nbsp;in Sicily and the Millie Miglia with maestro <a title=""Stirling Moss"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_Moss"">Stirling Moss</a> at the wheel.</p>
<p>However the brilliant performance of the 300SLR that year was overshadowed by an horrific accident at the <a title=""1955 Le Mans 24 hr"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster"">1955 Le Mans 24 hr</a> race, which claimed the lives of 82 spectators and the driver at the time, Pierre Levegh. The accident was shocking particularly because the body work of the car, fabricated in an expensive and ultralightweight magnesium rich aluminum alloy caught fire and could not be extinguished with the equipment available.</p>
<p>The accident had a devastating effect on motorsport and especially on Mercedes-Benz, who withdrew from motorsport for approximately thirty years.</p>
<p>Although the 300SLR may be forever connected to that horrible accident, it is undoubtably one of the all time great race cars and is just beautiful to look at, I think it deserves to be remembered for its wins that year and its beautiful design rather than the accident.&nbsp; If you agree wear our 300 SLR t shirt.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,300-slr,1955 Mercedes 300SLR,1955 Mercedes 300SLR,"<p>An absolutely stunning motorcar.

1938-rolling-stock,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Motor Vehicles,base,1938 Rolling Stock,"<p>This t-shirt design is in admiration of the carriages of the underground tube trains of 1938.</p>
<p>My admiration of this stock is based on the interior design of the carriages.The wooden floors and the handholds that hung from ceiling. I remember sitting in Hammersmith station, doing a survey about what I thought of the new rolling stock. Soulless and bland were my thoughts. They still are. Like the Routemaster bus, the aesthetics has been sacrificed for the sake of financial considerations.&nbsp; If you agree with me, wear this t-shirt.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,1938-rolling-stock,1938 Rolling Stock,1938 Rolling Stock,<p>1938 Rolling Stock T-shirt train t-shirts motor vehicles t-shirt category</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column

1984-books,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,base,1984 (eyes),"<p>This book has attracted, unbidden,&nbsp; a number of designers and is without a doubt the most represented book on our site. Britain has more surveillance cameras than anyone else in Europe, if not the world. In 1984, there was much in the media about Orwell's book and how it had not really come to fruition. Isn't it typical that we only look for the obvious. This pernicious trend towards a proliferation of camera's along with people's simplistic response of 'well if you have nothing to hide...', is what has allowed this to take hold. So don't forget, for you own safety, cameras have been set up on nearly every street in London to watch your every move. Let's hope that some future government doesn't misuse it. But that could never happen, right?&nbsp; Celebrate and admire George Orwell's extraordinary work and remind government that society is more important than they are, wear our 1984 eyes t shirt.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,1984-books,1984 (eyes),1984 (eyes),"<p>T-shirt celebrating the genius of George Orwell.

2001-a-space-odyssey,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Film,base,2001 Hello Dave,"<p>Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is (like Star Wars) hailed as one of the great contenders in the sci-fi genre - with so many references in pop culture and a countless number of parodies. (I think it is fantastic that Kubrick appreciated science enough to know there is no sound in the vacuum of space)<br /> <br /> This movie is many things. It's mentaly stimulating, awe inspireing, majestic, thrilling, perplexing and frustrating in equal measures, but there is one thing for sure the film is a masterpiece! This is bench mark sci-fi, that all sci-fi movies have been judged against ever since, and has inspired many other films including The original Star Trek movie (1979) The Abyss, Star Wars, Close Encounters. the list could go on. The plot of the film is baffling, and is paper thin, but that's not the point of the movie. I think the point is that you take away from the film what you want. For me it was the grace and majesty of the experience, from the ground breaking effects to the amazing use of music.&nbsp; Celebrate the work of Stanley Kubrick generally and 2001 specifically, wear out Hello Dave t shirt.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,2001-Hello-Dave-T-shirt,2001 Hello Dave,2001 Hello Dave,"<p>an expression of admiration for Stanley Kubrick's, 2001 a space odyssey t shirt from the film category.
