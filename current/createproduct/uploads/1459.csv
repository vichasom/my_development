While Bruce Robinson would follow this script with 'How to get ahead in advertising'.<br />Withnail &amp; I was a confluence of some of the best writing and acting of its time. It's lasting appeal being testament to that.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,withnail-i-here-hare-here,Withnail & I - Here Hare Here,Withnail & I - Here Hare Here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
