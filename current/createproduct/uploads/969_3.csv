Unlike bullfights, which are performed by professionals, anyone may participate in an encierro.<br /> The purpose of this event is the transport of the bulls from the off-site corrals where they had spent the night, to the bullring where they would be killed in the evening. Youngsters would jump among them to show off their bravado.<br /> Spanish lore says the true origin began in Northeastern Spain during the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell at the market, men would attempt to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as younger adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safe in the pen prior to the bulls. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,pamplona-bulls-t-shirt,Pamplona Bulls,Pamplona Bulls,"<p>This T-shirt admires the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_Bulls#Pamplona_bull_run"" target=""_blank"">Running of the Bulls in Pamplona</a> - The most famous running of the bulls is that of the nine-day festival of San Ferm&iacute;n in Pamplona, Spain.
