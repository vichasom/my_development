He was a very competent administrator, but he is famous for a diary he wrote that spanned almost ten years of life during the 1660's in England.</p>
<p>Pepys's diary is notable for its detailed and unique accounts of several major events of the 1660s. In particular it is an invaluable source for the study of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665-7, of the Great Plague of 1665, and of the Great Fire of London in 1666.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting thing about Pepys is that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665 and served as its President from 1 December 1684, to 30 November 1686. Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica was published during this period and its title-page bears Pepys' name. There is a probability problem, called the &quot;Newton&ndash;Pepys problem&quot;, that arose out of correspondence between Newton and Pepys about whether one is more likely to roll at least one six with six dice or at least two sixes with twelve dice.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,samuel-pepys-t-shirt,Samuel Pepys,Samuel Pepys,"<p>This t-shirt design admires Samuel Pepys who was an English MP and Naval administrator during the late 17th century.
