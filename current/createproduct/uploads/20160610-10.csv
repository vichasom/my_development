shakespeare-much-ado-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,"Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,Default Category/History & Politics",base,Shakespeare (Much Ado),"<p>This T-shirt design honors William Shakespeare who is without a doubt (in my mind) the most influential and talented writer that ever lived. Born over 450 years ago, William Shakespeare produced more than 35 plays, many of which are still famous today. He was extraordinary at introducing new words &amp; phrases into the English language with thousands of words and phrases credited to Shakespeare that have no written references before he had penned them. There are many quotes from shakespeare's plays and I have chosen my favourites to form a series dedicated to Shakespeare.</p>
