<p>London's music scene is hard to beat. It has got to one of the best in the world with some of the greatest musicians and pop stars performing some of their biggest shows, and the numerous, quality gig venues and park festivals that constantly please the music loving populous.<br /> <br /> There is also a strong and complex clubbing/dj/rave culture; from the mainstream clubs in Picadilly/Leicester Sq to the slightly more grunge and promiscuous soho, though to the more alternative camden and shoreditch. Not to mention the thousands of other clubs throughout the rest of london.<br /> There are high end, worldwide franchised clubs like Pacha and <a href=""http://www.ministryofsound.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ministry of Sound</a>, right down to the gritty and personal bunker sized clubs like Public Life (situated in an old underground public street toilet), not to mention the countless raves like mulletover and the late secretsundaze that sprawl through the warehouses, empty buildings, and carparks of london.<br /> <br /> Picturing the london skyline as a soundwave, this t-shirt celebrates this culture.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,london-soundwave-t-shirt,London Soundwave,London Soundwave,"<p>Picturing the london skyline as a soundwave, the shirt celebrates the Ministry of Sound.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
le-monde-est-a-vous-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Film,base,Le Monde est a vous,"<p>Mathieu Kassovitz&rsquo;s 1995 instant classic La Haine had a revitalising effect on French cinema. The film&rsquo;s main focus is on the life of 3 friends and a missing Policeman&rsquo;s revolver the day after a night of rioting in the Paris suburbs. Shot entirely in grainy black and white, the films main message seems to be anti-police with flashes of dark humour and edge of the seat tension. The film pays homage to classic gangster movies throughout with one character spraying over an advert &ldquo;the world is yours&rdquo; replacing &ldquo;yours&rdquo; with &ldquo;ours&rdquo; with a nod to Brian De Palma&rsquo;s Scarface.&nbsp; Celebrate a great French film wear our Le Monde est a vous t shirt.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,le-monde-est-a-vous-t-shirt,Le Monde est a vous,Le Monde est a vous,"<p>Le Monde est a vous T-shirt, from weadmire.net.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
