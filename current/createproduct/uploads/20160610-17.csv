robert-southey-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Literature & Philosophy,base,Robert Southey,"<p>This t-shirt design is in admiration of Robert Southey (12 August 1774 &ndash; 21 March 1843).</p>
<p><strong>Robert Southey</strong> was an English poet of the Romantic school, one of the so-called ""Lake Poets"", and <a href=""http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/PoetLaureate.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Poet Laureate</a> for 30 years from 1813 to his death in 1843. Although his fame tends to be eclipsed by that of his contemporaries and friends William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Southey's verse enjoys enduring popularity.</p>
<p>Moreover, Southey was a prolific letter writer, literary scholar, essay writer, historian and biographer. His biographies include the life and works of <a href=""http://www.chapellibrary.org/bunyan/"" target=""_blank"">John Bunyan</a>, John Wesley, William Cowper, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml"" target=""_blank"">Oliver Cromwell</a> and Horatio Nelson. The latter has rarely been out of print since its publication in 1813 and was adapted for the screen in the 1926 British film, <em>Nelson</em> . He was also a renowned Portuguese and Spanish scholar, translating a number of works of those two countries into English and writing both a <em>History of Brazil</em> (part of his planned <em>History of Portugal</em> which was never completed) and a <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> . Perhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the immortal children's classic, <em>The Story of the Three Bears</em> , the original Goldilocks story, which first saw print in 1834 in Southey's prose collection, <em>The Doctor</em> .</p>
<p>I admire Robert Southey so had to create a t-shirt design in his honour. Buy my Robert Southey t-shirt and help raise the profile of such an incredible writer and contributor to our history.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,robert-southey-t-shirt,Robert Southey,Robert Southey,"<p>Robert Southey (12 August 1774 &ndash; 21 March 1843) was an English poet of the Romantic school, one of the so-called ""Lake Poets"", and Poet Laureate for 30 years from 1813 to his death in 1843.

riot-grrrl-t-shirt,,Default,configurable,Default Category/Popular Culture,base,Riot Grrrl,"<p><strong>Riot grrrl</strong> was an underground feminist punk movement that started in the early 1990s, and it is often associated with third-wave feminism (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). However, riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are Fifth Column, Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Jack Off Jill, Excuse 17, Heavens to Betsy, Huggy Bear, Adickdid, The Third Sex, Sleater-Kinney, and also lesbian queercore like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene, riot grrrl is also a subculture; zines, the DIY ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,riot-grrrl-t-shirt,Riot Grrrl,Riot Grrrl,"<p>Riot Grrrl, the punk feminists are celebrated here at weadmire.
