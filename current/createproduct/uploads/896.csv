It talks about the maddening corrupting powers of lust before/leading up to- the act of sex, calling it bloody, murderous, extreme and not to trust, and once the act is done, shame follows and the thought of the act is despised. <br /> He speaks of lust as a bait laid to make the taker mad. <br /> (presumably he means lust and consummation through dishonourable means)<br /> Shakespeare is obviously writing from an older, more bible conscious time and it is reflected in the severity of his words, but the message still stands.</p>",,,1,Taxable Goods,"Catalog, Search",,,,,sonnet-129-t-shirt,Sonnet 129,Sonnet 129,<p>Shakespeare's 129th Sonnet is celebrated here with this witty t shirt from weadmire.net.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
